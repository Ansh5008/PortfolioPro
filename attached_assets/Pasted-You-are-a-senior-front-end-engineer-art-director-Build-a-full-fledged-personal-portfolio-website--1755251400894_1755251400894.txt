You are a senior front-end engineer + art director. Build a full-fledged personal portfolio website for **Ansh Kumar** with a premium dark, gothic-horror aesthetic (think: inky blacks, deep crimson accents, subtle film grain, glassmorphism, and micro-animations inspired by psychological horror). The site must be fast, accessible (WCAG AA+), responsive, and production-ready.

Tech stack:
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) or React + Vite (your choice, but prefer Next.js for SEO).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables for theme tokens.
- Animations: Framer Motion (parallax, reveal-on-scroll, subtle hover states).
- 3D/FX: Optional lightweight Three.js or shader-based noise for a drifting fog backdrop; use <canvas> or CSS for particle “embers”.
- Content: Typescript everywhere, ESLint + Prettier configured.

Theme & Art Direction:
- Palette: #0B0B0E (bg), #111218, #9B111E (blood-red accent), #C1C1C1 (muted gray), #7A0000 (deep red), off-white text (#EDEDED).
- Typography: Headings—serif or gothic display (e.g., "Cormorant Garamond" or "UnifrakturCook"); body—clean grotesk (e.g., "Inter").
- Visual motifs: Subtle fog/mist, grain/noise overlay, low-contrast vignette on hero, animated candle/glitch cursor on hover, neon-red underline effects.
- Keep it elegant—not cheesy. Avoid jump-scare clichés. Micro-interactions only.

Information Architecture (pages/sections):
1) Home/Hero
   - Name: **Ansh Kumar** (large gothic headline)
   - Tagline: “AI/ML • Cybersecurity • Open Source • Cloud (Google Cloud KMS)”
   - CTA buttons: View Work, Contact
   - Ambient fog layer, very light parallax.
2) About
   - Short bio: AI/ML + cybersecurity enthusiast, hackathon participant (2+ events), open-source contributor.
   - Skills grid: AI/ML, Python, React/Next, Google Cloud KMS, APIs, Security tooling.
   - Download CV button (PDF).
3) Projects
   - Cards with cover images (dark frames), tech badges, problem→approach→impact, links to GitHub/live.
   - Featured ideas: 
     - Schronix – Smart Academic Scheduler & Attendance Planner (AI)
     - AI Financial Advisor for Students (GPT-4o)
     - Face detection/recognition (Haar/ArcFace)
     - Mood detection AI
     - Security experiments (non-malicious educational tools)
4) Experience
   - Internships (e.g., CODSOFT), roles, responsibilities, quantified outcomes.
   - Hackathons: 2 events, role, submissions, results, learnings.
5) Blog/Notes (MDX)
   - Articles on AI/ML, cybersecurity, GCP KMS, agentic bots; dynamic routing, code blocks with copy buttons.
6) Open Source
   - GitHub activity feed (serverless API fetch), highlighted repos, contribution graph preview.
7) Contact
   - Form (name/email/message) with spam protection (honeypot) + email via serverless function.
   - Social links: GitHub, LinkedIn, X.
8) Resume
   - Nicely formatted page + “Download PDF” (server-side render).

Core Features:
- SEO: metadata, OpenGraph images, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, canonical URLs, structured data (JSON-LD).
- Performance: lazy-load images, next/image or responsive <img>, code-splitting, prefetch routes.
- Accessibility: keyboard focus states, aria labels, sufficient contrast, reduced-motion support.
- Theming utilities: prefers-reduced-motion, prefers-color-scheme, and a toggle for “Pure Black” vs “Textured Dark”.
- Analytics: Privacy-friendly (e.g., Vercel Analytics or Plausible).
- Error/empty states: graceful 404 with atmospheric “lost in the dark” illustration.
- CMS (optional): MDX files by default; allow an easy swap to Contentlayer/Sanity if needed.
- Testing: basic unit test for a component + Playwright smoke test for routes.

Design Details to Implement:
- Hero headline slowly reveals with mask + grain noise overlay.
- Hover on project cards: slight tilt, red glow outline, glitch text flicker (extremely subtle).
- Section dividers: thin red line with animated ember particles.
- Cursor: default, but on interactive elements show faint red aura.
- Background: low-opacity looping fog shader behind main content; ensure 60+ FPS on mid devices.

Deliverables:
- Complete Next.js (or React+Vite) project with:
  - `README.md` (setup, scripts, deploy to Vercel/Netlify)
  - `public/` favicon + social preview image (1200×630)
  - `/content/` for blog MDX + sample posts
  - Contact form serverless endpoint
  - Example projects populated with placeholder images & copy for Ansh
  - `eslint`, `prettier`, `tsconfig`, `tailwind.config.js`
- Provide copy placeholders using Ansh’s name and interests.
- Include image prompts for generating assets (e.g., “moody gothic desk, candlelight, red accent, film grain, 16:9”).
- Make it production-ready, minimal dependencies, clean file tree.

At the end, output:
1) A complete file tree.
2) Key code files inline (layout, theme, Hero, ProjectCard, Contact API).
3) Tailwind config and global CSS (grain/fog utilities, typography).
4) Instructions to run locally and deploy (Vercel/Netlify).
5) Suggestions for future upgrades (lightweight CMS, newsletter, dark synth soundtrack toggle).
